<h3><div ID=break>Description.</div></h3>
<p id=writeup>Ful Medames is a simple, yet beloved side dish in Middle Eastern cuisine, often referred to simply as "ful", pronounced not too differently from the English word "fool". An appropriate accompaniment to any meal of the day, ful is a delicious mixture of fava beans, chickpeas, tahini sauce, and whatever one might find tasty and appropriate to add to it. For now, we're going to keep it basic and stick to its unassailable, tried and true traditional form.</p>
<br><h3><div ID=break>Ingredients.</div></h3>
    <ul id=lists>
        <li>One can of fava beans (this will be the hardest to find; California Gardens sells a putatively Palestinian-recipe product containing, as is most common in preparing this dish, fava beans pre-mixed with chickpeas, soaking in their own brine. If this isn't available, try to find plain fava beans, otherwise substitute (not-advised) for pinto or something similar. If taking this route, expect indignation if preparing for habibti.</li>
        <li>One can of chickpeas (if the dual fava/chickpeas pre-mixture was unobtainable) -- in this case, you will either be making a double recipe in combining the two full cans, doubling the following ingredients, or using half of each can, saving the rest for another time.</li>
        <li>The fresh-squeezed juice of 1/2 lemon.</li>
        <li>One heaping spoonful of tahini sauce (stir up that jar beforehand).</li>
        <li>Around 3 cloves of minced or crushed garlic.</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
        <li>Pepper</li>
        <li>Olive oil (you <em>could</em> buy this from the store, if you don't have a relative to make it for you. But may Allah have mercy on your soul.</li>
        <li>Chopped tomatoes</li>
        <li>Chopped parsley</li>
        <br>
    </ul>
<h3><div ID=break>Steps.</div></h3>
<ol id="lists">
    <li>Open the can of fava/chickpeas, (or if you're going the second route, open the two cans) and pour the contents, with the liquid, into an appropriately-sized pan, and set to boil.</li>
    <li>After around 15 minutes, or once the beans have become soft enough to mash, remove from heat.</li>
    <li>Using a sieve, drain <em><strong>AND SAVE</strong></em> the remaining liquid.</li>
    <li>Gradually adding a bit of liquid at a time, mash the beans until they become a soft, moist paste. If they are too dry, add more water. You may end up using all the water, or you may not. In the latter case, drink it; it's delicious.</li>
    <li>Squeeze the juice of the half lemon into your bean mixture, using the sieve to ensure you needn't fish lemon seeds out of your beans.</li>
    <li>Add the crushed or minced garlic, and stir.</li>
    <li>Add one large spoonful of tahini sauce and stir until fully integrated.</li>
    <li>Add salt and pepper to taste.</li>
    <li>Transfer your ful into a bowl and top with a generous amount of olive oil.</li>
    <li>Finally, add your tomatoes and parsley on top as a garnish.</li>
    <li>Grab some flatbread, and get scooping. Sakhtain!</li>
